# applied!stack
_"They said it's horrible to combine rhythm game and stacking game. Well, they were right..."_

applied!stack is a ruleset for [osu!lazer](https://github.com/ppy/osu), which combines the importance of high IQ from stacking games and precision from rhythm games. This ruleset is more of a meme than a serious ruleset but hey, it's playable.

## Current Status
- Gameplay: **Playable**
- Autoplay: _Need improvement_

## Build the ruleset
```sh
# Build ruleset
dotnet build osu.Game.Rulesets.AppliedStack

# The output file will be located in osu.Game.Rulesets.AppliedStack/bin/Debug/netstandard2.1/osu.Game.Rulesets.AppliedStack.dll
```
